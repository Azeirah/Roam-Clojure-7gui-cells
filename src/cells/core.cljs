; how do you compute the spreadsheet?
; The oo way has an object 'cell' with an 'evaluate' method on it.
; it gets notified when it changes.
; I'm more comfortable with this option.
; Yet, I opted for a recursive strategy since this is Clojure

; There are two scenarios
; 1) Compute the entire spreadsheet
; 2) Recompute parts of the spreadsheet when something changes.
; Are these somehow equal?

; The first scenario is a little weird, when would this actually happen?
; never!
; But how do you represent change, and what does my evaluation function look like?
; Alternative approach
; 1) Subdivide the given spreadsheet into separate trees
; 2) Change `evaluate` into (fn evaluate [cell tree] ...) where
;    `cell` is a reference to the changed cell
;    `tree` is the dependency tree of the cell.
;


; spreadsheet dependency graph

; Case A
; Simplest case: 1 node
; :A1 holds a value
; {:A1 "hello world!"}
; Graph:
;; :A1

; Case B
; One dependency: linear dependency
; {:A1 "=B1" :B1 "hello world"}
; Graph:
;; :A1 -> :B1

; Case C
; Multiple linearly chained dependencies
; {:A1 "=B1" :B1 "=C1" :C1 "=D1" :D1 "Hello world"}
; Graph:
;; :A1 -> :B1 -> :C1 -> :D1

; Case D
; Branched dependency
; {:A1 "=C1" :B1 "=C1" :C1 "Hello world"}
; Graph:
;; :A1 ->
;;       |-> :C1
;; :B1 ->

; Case E
; Circular dependency (problematic!)
; {:A1 "=B1" :B1 "=A1"}
; Graph:
;; :A1 <-> :B1

; Case F
; Multiple independent graphs within one spreadsheet
; {:A1 "=B1" :B1 "Hello" :C1 "=D1" :D1 " world!"}
; Graph
;; :A1 -> :B1
;; :C1 -> :D1

; So, what can we do? We have three requirements
; 1) The values of all cells get computed
; 2) No subgraph gets recomputed when unchanged
; 3) Disallow circular dependencies

; So far, I'm thinking of these steps
; 1) Subdivide the spreadsheet into independent graphs รก la case F
;    This makes it so we have a well-defined data-structure to work with. A dependency graph
; 2) Check whether any graph has a circular dependency. If so, abort the entire thing
;    This is easiest to do within a separate step, instead of performing this -during- computation
;    separating the responsibilities of different algorithms.

; The third step is computation. This is not necessarily very difficult
; Computing each node recursively is just a matter of calling pseudocode like this within the
; compute function

; The problem is the caching. When exactly does a reference need to be recomputed?
; I think it is actually not super complicated after a little bit of playing around
; with graphs on paper.
; hypothesis:
; If we change any branch (root or leaf)
; Then take that branch as the root of its respective branches
; all branches need to be recomputed.

; A leaf in a dependency graph always has to contain a value.
; If a leaf changes, everything depending on that leaf needs to be recomputed.

; What if a root changes?
; Only the root itself needs to be recomputed

; What if a branch changes?
; The branch along with the entire lower-branches of the tree need to be recomputed.

; In short, my hypothesis seems to be almost correct, just inverted.
; If a cell changes, recompute that cell along with all of its recursive roots
